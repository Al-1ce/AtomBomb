# Legio Invicta v.1.0

## Who made this module?
Pebbles the 2nd. Credits at the end.

## What is this module?
Legion art/assets, to improve quality and make maintaining it easier.

Core principles:
- Icon, onmob sprites, inhands for all items, palette created and enforced, focus on the final coordinated appearance, not each item in a vacuum.

## Is it complete?
Its as complete as I ever will make it, its my last thing I do for FO13 so enjoy.

## Who dunnit
Vast majority of the content are my orignals, a portion is originally based on legacy concepts though, like the bandana general design, the base legion tunic also has to be included here. 
A few of on-mob armor sprites borrows parts of the shoulder design from the armor set in the Wasteland assets, so some inspiration came from those sprites.
The Legion cloak is based on a existing sprite and re-uses parts of two different sprites. Credit for the concept goes to the creators, who I sadly do not know the name of.
Melee weapons borrowing heavily from legacy in either onmobs or icon (goliath icon, thermic lance onmob)
(rugged holster, rocket hammer, ripper, spatha, gladius, machete, goliath, lance, training machete, medallions, marching satchel, survival package, medical kit, goggles, plated & fingerless gloves, legion belt)
